## Abstract
In this lecture, we give an elementary proof of the result given by Schenzel that there are functorial isomorphisms between local cohomology groups and Čech cohomology groups, by using weakly proregular sequences. In [Sch03](https://www.mscand.dk/article/view/14399), he used notions of derived category theory in his proof, but we do not use them in this seminor.
