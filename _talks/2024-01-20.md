## Abstract
Homological methods are well studied in commutative ring theory. These methods have been used to
study the properties of ideals in rings whose ideals are not necessarily finitely generated. In this talk, we introduce the generalization of the theorems of Noetherian rings by homological methods and topics of classes of some rings.
