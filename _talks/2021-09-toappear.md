## Abstract
This seminar is scheduled for the autumn of 2021.　In this lecture, we introduce weakly proregular sequence by Schenzel to study whether there is an isomorphism between Čech cohomology and local cohomology. In [Schenzel's paper](https://www.mscand.dk/article/view/14399), He proved that for the Local cohomology and the Čech cohomology defined by the sequence $a_1$, the equivalence is that $a_1$ is weakly proregular and that there is an isomorphism between these cohomologies.
