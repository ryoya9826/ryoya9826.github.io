## Abstract
This seminar is scheduled for the autumn of 2021. In this lecture, we introduce weakly proregular sequence by Schenzel to study whether there is an isomorphism between Čech cohomology and local cohomology. In [Schenzel's paper](https://www.mscand.dk/article/view/14399), he proved that for the Local cohomology and the Čech cohomology defined by the sequence $\underline{a}=a_1,\dots,a_r$, $\underline{a}$ is weakly proregular if and only if there is an isomorphism between these cohomologies. We give an elementary proof of his theorem without using notions of derived category theory.
