## Abstract
Quantum information technology is not only of theoretical and research importance, but is also being actively used in industry. In this talk, we will give an overview of industrial trends not only in Japan but also in the world, and introduce the potential applications of quantum sensors, including several case studies.

At this hands-on event, visitors can experience quantum sensors from Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd and Tokyo Institute of Technology.

This work was performed for Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (CSTI), Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP), “Promoting the application of advanced quantum technology platforms to social issues”(Funding agency : QST).
