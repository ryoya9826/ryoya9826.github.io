- ### A NOTE ON WEAKLY PROREGULAR SEQUENCE
  - Accepted in _Moroccan Journal of Algebra and Geometry with Applications_ . Link: [Journal](https://ced.fst-usmba.ac.ma/p/mjaga/articles-in-press/),[arXiv:2105.07652](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07652)
  - In this note, we give an elementary proof of the result given by Schenzel that there are functorial isomorphisms between local cohomology groups and ÄŒech cohomology groups, by using weakly proregular sequences. In [Schenzel's paper](https://www.mscand.dk/article/view/14399), he used notions of derived category theory in his proof, but we do not use them in this paper.
