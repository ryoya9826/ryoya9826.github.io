## Comment

In this paper, we give an elementary proof of the result given by Schenzel that there are functorial iso-
morphisms between local cohomology groups and Ë‡Cech cohomology groups, by using weakly proregular
sequences. The existence of these isomorphisms was well-known for Noetherian rings, but he generalised it
to non-Noetherian rings and gave necessary and sufficient conditions for cohomology to coincide. In [Schenzel's paper](https://www.mscand.dk/article/view/14399), he
used notions of derived category theory in his proof, but we do not use them in this paper. We give a proof
within Abelian category theory.
